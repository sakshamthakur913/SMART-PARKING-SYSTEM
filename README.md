# SMART-PARKING-SYSTEM
ðŸ“Œ Scope of the Project: Smart Parking System using IoT, Real-Time Data, and Sensors
1.	Real-Time Slot Monitoring
o	The system will detect and display real-time status (occupied/vacant) of each parking slot using IoT sensors.
2.	User Interface for Parking Availability
o	A mobile application or web-based dashboard will show users the available slots in a specific area or parking lot.
3.	Sensor-Based Detection Mechanism
o	Hardware setup will include proximity or IR sensors connected to microcontrollers (like Arduino/Raspberry Pi) for vehicle detection.
4.	Centralized Data Storage and Access
o	Slot information will be uploaded to a central database or cloud, accessible by users and administrators in real time.
5.	Admin Dashboard for Monitoring and Management
o	System administrators will be able to manage slots, view usage statistics, and generate reports for better planning.
6.	Traffic Decongestion in Urban Areas
o	By reducing the time spent searching for parking, the system indirectly contributes to smoother traffic flow and less congestion.
7.	Data Collection for Smart City Integration
o	Historical data on parking trends can be used by city planners for urban infrastructure development and traffic management.
8.	Scalability and Modularity
o	The system is designed to be modular so it can be scaled from small private lots to large public or multi-level parking facilities.
